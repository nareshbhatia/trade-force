# Trade Force

Trade Force is a sample trading application to demonstrates best practices in
software development such as:

1. [REST maturity level 3 API](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)
2. Rendering a large dataset in [ag-Grid]() using the Server-Side Row Model

It also demonstrates the use of server-side logic to control a business workflow,
based on user roles and permissions.
